# Building-the-Bike-Data-Lakehouse
This project demonstrates how to build a production-style Data Lakehouse from scratch using Databricks and the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).Starting from raw CSV source files, the project ingests data into a governed landing zone, transforms it through structured Bronze and Silver layers, and delivers analytics-ready Gold datasets.
